These are some CSS Frameworks I found quite interesting. We may end up using one or more CSS Frameworks depending on our UI and stylings.

1. Bootstrap

2. Skeleton

3. Foundation


These are the choices we have for JS Frameworks / libraries. Still need to decide which one to use

1. Angular

2. React

3. Node

4. jQuery
