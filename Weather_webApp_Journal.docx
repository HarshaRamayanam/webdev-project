			Weather Web application Journal

	I started project work by first selecting the topic. After searching many other topics, I chooses to build Weather web application. 
	Initially I designed project idea like how does web page should look like. Then I started reading about JS frameworks and library. I did some research about frameworks then I decided to choose React because it’s a good framework to start as a beginner. I read about React and how to use React to build web application. As I am using React for the first time, I did some research about React.
